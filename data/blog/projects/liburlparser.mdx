## Overview

`liburlparser` is a high-performance domain extractor library designed for parsing URLs in C++ and Python, as well as from the command line. It provides an intuitive interface that is consistent across supported languages, making it a versatile tool for developers working with web URLs and domains.

The library offers a range of features, including:

- Support for multiple programming languages: Python, C++, and Shell.
- Two separate classes, `Url` and `Host`, for clean and organized code.
- Automatic updates to the public suffix list before each build and deployment.
- Extraction and recognition of known and unknown TLDs (Top-Level Domains).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- For C++ usage, a C++17 compatible compiler is required.
- For Python usage, Python version 3.8 or higher is required.

### Installation

#### C++ Setup

To build and install the C++ part of the library, follow these steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mohammadraziei/liburlparser
mkdir -p build; cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

#### Python and Command Line Setup

Install the library using pip:

```sh
pip install liburlparser
```

For updating the public suffix list, install with the `online` option:

```sh
pip install "liburlparser[online]"
```

Alternatively, you can install directly from the git repository:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/mohammadraziei/liburlparser
```

Or manually:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mohammadraziei/liburlparser
pip install ./liburlparser
```

## Tutorial with Examples

### Command Line Usage

After installation, you can use `liburlparser` from the command line:

```sh
python -m liburlparser --url "https://mail.google.com/about" | jq
python -m liburlparser --host "mail.google.com" | jq
```

### Python Usage

Here's how you can use `liburlparser` in Python:

```python
from liburlparser import Url, Host

# Parse a URL:
url = Url("https://ee.aut.ac.ir/#id")
print(url, url.suffix, url.domain, url.fragment, url.host, url.to_dict(), url.to_json())

# Parse a host:
host = Host("ee.aut.ac.ir")
# or
host = Host.from_url("https://ee.aut.ac.ir/#id")
print(host, host.domain, host.suffix, host.to_dict(), host.to_json())

# Extract the host of a URL as a string:
host_str = Url.extract_host("https://ee.aut.ac.ir/about")
```

### C++ Usage

Below is an example of how to use `liburlparser` in C++:

```c++
#include "urlparser.h"

int main() {
    // Parse a URL:
    TLD::Url url("https://ee.aut.ac.ir/about");
    std::string domain = url.domain(); // Also for subdomain, port, params, etc.

    // Parse a host:
    TLD::Host host("ee.aut.ac.ir");
    // or
    TLD::Host host = url.host();
    // or
    TLD::Host host = TLD::Host::fromUrl("https://ee.aut.ac.ir/about");

    return 0;
}
```

## Performance

`liburlparser` has been benchmarked against other libraries and has shown to be highly efficient in extracting domains from URLs and hosts.
