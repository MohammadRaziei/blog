# Accelerating MRI Speed Using Signal Processing and Deep Learning Techniques

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized medical diagnostics by providing non-invasive visualization of soft tissues within the human body. However, the relatively slow speed of MRI imaging presents challenges from medical and economic standpoints. To address this issue, a groundbreaking research project conducted at Sharif University under the supervision of Vosoghi Vahdat has explored innovative approaches to accelerate MRI speed while maintaining high image quality.

## Understanding MRI: Physics and Signal Processing Perspectives

The study delves deeply into the physical fundamentals of MRI imaging and the associated signal processing techniques. Two crucial perspectives – physics and signal processing – have been thoroughly investigated to enhance MRI speed. The project focuses specifically on the signal processing approach, aiming to achieve high-quality images using undersampled data, while ensuring that the reduction in samples aligns with the fundamental physics of MRI and effectively reduces imaging time.

## Integration of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning Techniques

In a remarkable leap forward, the researchers integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning techniques with the concept of compressed sensing. Various methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and auto-encoder structures were explored using multi-channel data.

## Novel Approach with UNET: Boosting Imaging Speed and Quality

A key breakthrough in the project was the development of a novel approach utilizing a deep structure with UNET. Initially, the k-space domain was processed to recover lost information, setting the stage for a transformative enhancement in imaging speed. Subsequently, the output from all channels was transferred to the image domain, where the amalgamation of information resulted in high-quality images. The method achieved an impressive 5 to 10-fold increase in MRI imaging speed while also achieving a slight but notable improvement in image quality.

## Introducing LMGNR Criterion: A New Benchmark for Image Quality Assessment

In addition to the remarkable speed enhancement, the project introduced a new criterion – LMGNR – designed to assess image quality without requiring a reference image. The LMGNR criterion has showcased superior performance compared to existing methods, solidifying its potential as a game-changer in the field of MRI imaging.

## Implications and Future Prospects

The findings of this thesis research have significant implications for enhancing the capabilities of MRI imaging technology. By successfully combining advanced signal processing and deep learning techniques, the project has opened new frontiers for further advancements in medical imaging, with the potential to improve patient care and diagnostic accuracy.

The impact of this research extends beyond academia. The physics aspect of this project has been published as a book, emphasizing the significance and influence of the work conducted at Sharif University. This publication serves as a testament to the commitment to excellence and innovation in advancing medical imaging technology.

In summary, the project represents a groundbreaking endeavor, positioning Sharif University and its researchers at the forefront of accelerating MRI speed through novel signal processing and deep learning techniques. The journey from conceptualization to implementation has not only contributed to expanding scientific knowledge but also holds the promise of transforming medical imaging practices for the better.
